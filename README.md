# FingerprintScanner_GT511C1R
This is a C++ library for operating the GT511C1R fingerprint scanner from ADH Technology.

This project is currently still being worked on and although it is currently capable of fully operating the scanner, a number of convenience functions are still missing.

The project will be completed and readme updated with a more complete tutorial within the next few weeks.
